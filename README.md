# **_ An Amazon Storefront From The Back-End (b-amazon)_**

# *Please Note:*
    This is a CLI App, it cannot be deployed to GitHub pages.
    
    I included screenshots, and or a GIF, and or a video showing that I have the app working with no bugs.
    
    Following, is information as it relates to the application:

# **__What Problem Does The Application Solve?__**  
It solves the problem of being able to develop, employ and manipulate relational databases

while using our local computers as servers. 
# **__What Is The App Doing and Why?__** 
The app is taking information from a MySQL database and transferring it to node.js. 
This way an app can be developed through the use of Javascript which will allow data use for business functioning.

# **__How Is The App Organized?__** 
 The app is organized to receive javaScript commands as they realate to node, use data from MySQL, and return data via the command prompt line using node in terminal/bash. 

# **__How Do You Run The App?__** 
You run the app by doing the following:
1. Ensure you have the following installed:
